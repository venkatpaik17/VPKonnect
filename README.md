## Introduction

### What is VPKonnect?

VPKonnect is a personal project focused on developing a basic social media API, conceptually inspired from Instagram's design. This project reflects my current, limited understanding of the complexities of social media platform functionality.

### Why VPKonnect?

I started this project to gain a basic understanding of API design and implementation, while also exploring the complexities of application development. I wanted to see how different technologies connect and interact, opening myself up to new possibilities and concepts in backend development. More than that, this was my way of breaking out of the "tutorial loop". I wanted to get past the need to know everything before starting and just dive in with an idea and learn as I developed, even if it meant feeling a bit lost and uncomfortable along the way. This is a brute-force project where the focus is purely on getting things to work rather than efficiency or best practices. It has been more of a test for myself to see if I have the patience, the persistence to push through challenges, and the curiosity to keep learning as I go.

### How did it start?

It all started with a simple goal that I wanted to build an application while keeping it easy to understand and implement. I came across a Python API development tutorial by Sanjeev Thiyagarajan on FreeCodeCamp, followed along, and worked through it. After completing it, I wanted to take things a step further and build something of my own using the basics I had learned. Thatâ€™s when I decided to create a basic Instagram-like backend API and named it VPKonnect.

## Tech Stack

>[!WARNING]
> PostgreSQL 12.xx is deprecated and hence no longer available on Docker Hub. While PostgreSQL 13 is a viable alternative, it hasnâ€™t been integrated yet. For now, the Docker setup pulls the required version from a private registry to prevent compatibility issues. Once the application is tested and verified on PostgreSQL 13, the repository will be updated accordingly.

- **Python 3.10.13/3.10.16**
- **FastAPI 0.100.0**
- **PostgreSQL 12.19/12.22**
- **SQLAlchemy 1.4.49**
- **Alembic 1.11.2**
- **pgAdmin4 8.xx/9.xx**
- **Postman**

docker exec -it <container-name> /bin/bash
```

- `-a`: List all containers 
- `-v`: Volumes  
- `-f`: Follow mode, real-time log streaming  
- `-i`: Interactive, interact with container
- `-t`: TTY (terminal), pseudo-terminal insider container


### Download and Install Postman
- [Postman Download](https://www.postman.com/downloads/)

### Import Postman Collection, Environment and Package Library

>[!IMPORTANT]
> 1. Postman requires **Account Sign-In** to access collections and environments.
> 2. If you find other alternatives to Postman that are compatible with Postman collections, environments, and package scripts, you can use those as well.

  1. Open Postman -> Create Account/Sign-In.
  2. Create New Workspace.
  3. Click on **Import** button on the top-left side of the app screen.
  4. Select the files `VPKonnect.postman_collection.json` and `VPKonnect.postman_environment.json` from the [Postman folder](./Postman/) and import.
  5. You can now access APIs and Environment.
  6. Go to Collections, click on any request which has scripts (Ex: User Register).
  7. Go to **Scripts** tab, on the right side, click on **Open package library**.
  8. Click on **New Package** to create a package, name it `vpkonnect_scripts`.
  9. Copy the JS code from [package.js](./Postman/package.js) to `vpkonnect_scripts` package and Save.
  10. Click the **No environment** dropdown on top-right side of the app screen and select **VPKonnect** from the list.

### Install a Database Management Tool
- **pgAdmin 4:** [Download](https://www.pgadmin.org/download/)  
- **Alternative:** DBeaver or any other PostgreSQL client

Open pgAdmin 4 -> Servers -> Register. Add details and connect to database  

### Getting Started

> [!NOTE] 
> 1. Read [Project Notes](#project-notes)
> 2. Refer [Full API Documentation (Redoc)](https://venkatpaik17.github.io/VPKonnect/)
> 3. Refer [schemas](app/schemas/), [enum.py](app/utils/enum.py), and [map.py](app/utils/map.py) for certain column attributes and other route parameters.  
> 4. Refer [init_function.sql](app/init_sql/init_function.sql), and [function_trigger.sql](app/sql/function_trigger.sql) for sql functions and triggers.  
> 5. While testing APIs in Postman, you can monitor the execution of pre-request and post-response scripts using the *Console* located at the bottom-left of the Postman app.

## Project Notes

### Consecutive Violation Actions

The system manages consecutive violation actions (such as restrictions and bans) that are stacked sequentially. Hereâ€™s how it works:

- **Active Violation Action:**
   - If there is already an active violation action (like a restriction or ban), any subsequent violation that occurs is handled as a *future action*.
   - The *future action* is scheduled to be enforced once the current action expires. 

- **Appeal Handling (Early Action Enforcement):**
   - If an appeal is submitted for the current active violation action, and the appeal is accepted, the current action is revoked immediately.
   - The next violation action in the sequence is then enforced right away, even before the original action duration expires. This is referred to as *early action enforcement*.

#### Flow: <!-- omit in toc -->

- A violation occurs -> A current action (restriction/ban) is enforced.
- Another violation is reported and resolved -> The *future action* is queued up to be enforced after the current action finishes.
- If the current action is appealed and accepted -> The action is revoked immediately, and the next action is enforced right away.


### Check Appeal Policy  

1. **Appeal Type: Account | Report Type: Account**  
   - If a previous appeal to revoke a ban on at least one valid flagged content post linked to the account restriction/ban was rejected (REJ), an appeal to revoke the restriction/ban on that account cannot be made.  

2. **Appeal Type: Account | Report Type: Post/Comment**  
   - If a previous appeal to revoke a ban on a post/comment linked to the account restriction/ban was rejected (REJ), an appeal to revoke the restriction/ban on that account cannot be made.  

3. **Appeal Type: Post | Report Type: Account**  
   - If a previous appeal to revoke an account restriction/ban linked to the valid flagged content post ban was rejected (REJ), an appeal to revoke the ban on those valid flagged content posts cannot be made.  

4. **Appeal Type: Post/Comment | Report Type: Post/Comment**  
   - If a previous appeal to revoke an account restriction/ban linked to a post/comment ban was rejected (REJ), an appeal to revoke the ban on that post/comment cannot be made.  


### Report/Appeal Handling Flow  

1. Content Moderator Admins review all submitted reports and appeals on the Admin Dashboard.  
2. They assign all these reports and appeals to appropriate content moderators for further review and action.  
3. Content Moderators access their dashboards to view assigned reports and appeals.  
4. Moderators place necessary reports and appeals under review before proceeding.  
5. For appeals, moderators must verify compliance with the appeal policy before making a decision.  
6. Moderators thoroughly review each case and take appropriate action based on the findings.  


### User Restrictions Based on Restriction Level  

#### Partial Restriction (RSP) User:  <!-- omit in toc -->
- Cannot like a post.  
- Cannot comment on a post.  
- Can follow/unfollow users.  
- User profile remains visible.  
- Other users (followers for private accounts and everyone for public accounts) can interact with the RSP userâ€™s posts (like, comment, follow, etc.).  
- Can publish new posts.  
- Can edit posts.  
- Can delete any post except for banned (BAN) posts.  
- Cannot like a comment.  
- Cannot edit comments.  
- Can delete comments (own or others').  

#### Full Restriction (RSF) User:  <!-- omit in toc -->
- Cannot like a post.  
- Cannot comment on a post.  
- Cannot follow/unfollow users.  
- User profile remains visible.  
- Other users (followers for private accounts and everyone for public accounts) can interact with the RSF userâ€™s posts (like, comment, follow, etc.).  
- Cannot publish new posts.  
- Cannot edit posts.  
- Cannot delete posts except those flagged to be banned (FLB).  
- Cannot like a comment.  
- Cannot edit comments.  
- Comment Deletion Rules:  
    - If the RSF user is the post owner, they can delete only other users' comments but not their own.  
    - If the RSF user is the comment owner, they cannot delete their own comments.  
    - Exception: Comments flagged to be banned (FLB) can be deleted.


### FLB, FLD, and BAN Status for Posts/Comments  

- **BAN** (Banned): Used for immediate removal of content due to policy violations.  
- **FLB** (Flagged to be Banned): Used for future action, marking the post/comment for a scheduled ban.  
- **FLD** (Flagged Deleted): Applied when an FLB post/comment is deleted by the user.  

#### Behavior of FLB Posts/Comments:  <!-- omit in toc -->
- **Visibility:**  
  - FLB posts are visible only to the owner on their profile.  
  - FLB posts are hidden from followers (private accounts) and public (public accounts). 
  - FLB posts do not appear in user feeds but can still be fetched if the post ID is known.  
  - FLB comments will be listed under the "flagged comments" section of a post.  

- **Restrictions on FLB Content:**  
  - Cannot be edited.
  - Cannot be liked/unliked. 
  - Users who liked an FLB post/comment cannot be fetched.

- **Enforcement & Deletion Rules:**  
  - When the scheduled future action is enforced, FLB content changes to BAN.  
  - If a post/comment is FLB, FLD, or BAN and the user deactivates (DAH/PDH), the status does not change to HID (Hidden).  
  - If a user deletes an FLB post/comment (FLD), it does not affect the scheduled enforcement, the violation action will still be applied.  
  - When a post/comment with FLD/BAN status is deleted (e.g., due to account deletion), the status remains unchanged, but `is_deleted = True` is set to indicate deletion.


### Non-Adaptive User Restrictions (RSF/RSP)  

The current restriction system applies a fixed set of limitations when a user is placed under Partial (RSP) or Full (RSF) Restriction. However, these restrictions are not adaptive to the user's specific violation patterns.  

For example:  
- If a user repeatedly violates policies through posts, the restriction should focus more on limiting post-related actions rather than comments.  
- If a userâ€™s violations are mostly comment-related, the restriction should prioritize comment limitations instead of broadly applying both post and comment restrictions.  

A more dynamic approach should assess the userâ€™s violation history and apply tailored restrictions based on their behavior. This would ensure more effective moderation while preventing unnecessary limitations on areas where the user has not shown problematic activity.


### Postman Testing Involving Redirection  

> [!NOTE]
> Go to Postman -> Settings -> Under **Headers** section, look for **Automatically follow redirects**

- **Root Endpoint (`GET localhost:8000/api/v0/`)**  
  - Automatic Redirection: **ON**  
  - Required to properly handle potential redirects automatically 

- **Get Post Endpoint (`GET localhost:8000/api/v0/posts/{post_id}`)**  
  - Automatic Redirection: **OFF**  
  - Redirection is handled in post-response script

## Project Experience, Mistakes, What Next?

### Experience

I started this project as a challenge, thinking I could wrap it up in a few months and maybe even take it end to end. But as time went on, I realized just how complex things could get. It was a roller coaster ride, some nights, I would literally dream about code, and at times, I'd wake up with solutions in my head.

There were days of intense progress and days where nothing moved forward. Sometimes, I would be completely blank, and other times, I felt like quitting altogether. Iâ€™d fix one thing only to realize something else had broken. Some debugging sessions stretched for hours, only to end with the realization that it was a small mistake or a misunderstanding on my part.

Despite all the ups and downs, it was a valuable experience. I gained confidence, not that I could do it perfectly, but that I could do it. More importantly, this whole journey sparked a deeper interest and curiosity in me to keep learning, improving, and exploring new things.

### Mistakes

1. **REST API Design Fundamentals** â€“ Due to limited knowledge, I lacked clarity on properly implementing REST principles. I tried my best to do it right, but with more understanding, I know I can improve significantly.
2. **Ignoring Unit Testing** â€“ This was my biggest mistake in the project. Debugging became a painful process, and evaluating different use cases was much harder than it should have been. I had to rely on manual testing and intuition, which was inefficient and unreliable. Proper unit testing would have given me better test coverage and a structured framework to validate functionality after making changes.
3. **Improper Exception Handling** â€“ I realized I lacked fundamental knowledge in handling exceptions effectively. I used them to the best of my understanding, but as the project grew and involved multiple and nested functions, it became difficult to track errors. Additionally, I could have implemented custom exceptions to handle specific errors more efficiently. A structured approach would have improved debugging and made error responses more meaningful.
4. **Logging** â€“ I have used logging in my project, but I feel I could do much better. More practical usage examples, such as structured logging, logging levels, and proper log management, would help me implement it more effectively. Right now, my logging approach is okay, and improving it could enhance debugging, monitoring, and troubleshooting.
5. **Poor Documentation of Changes** â€“ I didn't properly track or document design and business logic changes. Additionally, I didn't account for dependencies, making it harder to assess the impact of modifications.
6. **Lack of Strong Fundamentals** â€“ Since this project was an extension of a basic tutorial, gaps in my foundational knowledge affected how I used frameworks, libraries, and packages. This led to errors and non-standard practices.
7. **Neglecting Clean Code & Refactoring** â€“ I didnâ€™t prioritize clean coding practices or refactoring, which resulted in messy and hard-to-maintain code. My focus was primarily on making things functional rather than writing well-structured, readable, and efficient code. While this approach helped me move forward quickly, it also made debugging and future modifications more challenging.
8. **Handling Reports During DAH/PDH** â€“ When a user was Deactivated (DAH) or Permanently Deactivated (PDH), I should have ensured their reports were hidden (HID). This oversight led to inconsistencies in report management.
9. **Inconsistent Consecutive Violation Handling for PBN** â€“ When handling consecutive violations, I overlooked a key inconsistency in report actions. If a Permanent Ban (PBN) was already scheduled for a future violation, another PBN triggered by a separate report action created conflicts. Since PBN is the final stage of a ban, stacking multiple PBNs does not make sense and leads to enforcement inconsistencies.
10. **Dependent on Postman** â€“ The project relies on Postman for API testing, including the use of Postman scripts. While there are alternative tools compatible with Postman files, the project should not be tightly coupled to a specific tool for better flexibility and maintainability.
11. **Use of PostgreSQL Triggers** â€“ Using PostgreSQL triggers unnecessarily increased system complexity and made tracking operations harder. A better approach would have been to manage most operations in the application code, reserving triggers for shared and repetitive tasks across multiple routes.

### What Next?

1. **Deep Dive into Core Concepts** â€“ Explore in-depth the technologies and principles I used in this project, ensuring I fully understand their capabilities and best practices.  
2. **Adopt Best Practices** â€“ Focus on writing maintainable, scalable, and efficient code by following industry standards and design principles.  
3. **Prioritize Clean Code** â€“ Improve code readability, structure, and organization to make it easier to maintain and extend.  
4. **Learn System Design** â€“ Get familiar with designing scalable and efficient systems, understanding architecture patterns, and making better design decisions.  
5. **Work on Side Projects** â€“ Apply what Iâ€™ve learned by building new projects, refining my skills, and exploring different problem domains.  
6. **Master Testing** â€“ Focus on unit testing, integration testing, and automation to ensure reliability and maintainability of code.  
7. **Read Professional Codebases** â€“ Analyze well-structured open-source projects and production-level code to understand how experienced developers write and organize their code.  
8. **Improve Documentation** â€“ Develop the habit of documenting code, design decisions, and API structures to improve clarity and maintainability.  
9. **Experiment with Different Technologies** â€“ Explore new frameworks, tools, and approaches to expand my knowledge and adaptability in backend development.
